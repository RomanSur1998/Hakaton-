            A seven-time world champion. The most wins, pole positions, and
            podium finishes in Formula One history. An environmentalist, social
            activist, fashion designer, musician, and a force for global change
            in combating racism and pushing for increased diversity in
            motorsport. Knighted in the New Year Honours and named as one of
            Time Magazine’s 100 most influential people in 2020. There are many
            sides to Sir Lewis Hamilton. Few sportspeople have had the impact
            that he has had not only in his own sport but beyond, and at 38 he
            is still hungry to achieve and deliver more. A sensation in karting,
            Lewis’ enormous talent was recognised early in his career by
            Mercedes-Benz who began sponsoring him from a young age. He climbed
            the karting ladder quickly, joining the McLaren Mercedes Young
            Driver Programme in 1997 before embarking on single-seaters. Success
            followed swiftly with titles in Formula Renault UK, the Formula 3
            Euro Series and a dominant rookie campaign in the 2006 GP2 Series
            securing his promotion to F1 with McLaren Mercedes. Making his debut
            at the age of just 22, alongside reigning World Champion Fernando
            Alonso, Lewis’ maiden F1 season was a remarkable one. He remained in
            title contention until the very last round and narrowly missed out
            on the title by just one point. The world championship would become
            his the very next year though, sealing the crown in one of the most
            dramatic title deciders in the sport’s history.

            After six seasons with McLaren, he sought a new challenge for 2013
            and joined the works Mercedes team. A single victory that year said
            little of what was to come. In 2014, with the dawn of a new era in
            the sport owing to a major Power Unit change, a second Drivers’
            Championship followed. 10 wins and 17 total podiums in 2015 netted a
            third world title before Lewis narrowly missed out on retaining his
            crown in 2016. Bouncing back in 2017, Lewis secured the title with
            two rounds to spare and began a run of four consecutive Drivers’
            Championships. En route, he shattered many of the most prestigious
            records in the sport including surpassing Michael Schumacher’s tally
            of F1 race wins in 2020. At the Turkish Grand Prix that same year,
            he matched Michael’s record of world titles with his seventh
            championship. An intense 2021 season saw Lewis became the first
            driver to reach both 100 wins and 100 pole positions in the sport’s
            history. After a year-long battle, he narrowly lost out to Red
            Bull’s Max Verstappen in controversial circumstances but still
            helped Mercedes to its eighth consecutive Constructors’ title. Last
            year proved less successful on track for the Team with a difficult
            car to get on top of. However, Lewis is as determined as ever for
            the season ahead. “I feel calm, I feel energised, and my focus is
            sharpened.”
